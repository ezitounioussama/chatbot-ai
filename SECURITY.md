## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of our AI Chatbot for security updates:

> **Note:** Versions earlier than 1.0 are no longer maintained and do not receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in our project, please help us keep our community safe by following these steps:

1. **Include Details:**  
   Provide clear steps to reproduce the issue, the potential impact, and any relevant logs or error messages.

2. **Keep It Confidential:**  
   Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

3. **Response Time:**  
   We aim to acknowledge all vulnerability reports within 48 hours and will keep you informed of our progress toward a resolution.

4. **Feedback & Rewards:**  
   If the vulnerability is verified, we may consider offering recognition or a reward at our discretion.

We appreciate your cooperation and thank you for helping us maintain a secure platform.
